AI-Shell--C--
========================================
This is a numeric AI Shell for use in C#.

Version History
========================================
Version 1.0 - Create a basic set of rules and conditions which allow for simple numeric comparisons to be made.

Feature Set
=========================================
Done
-----------------------------------------
 * Conditions with Numeric, Set, and Existance based testing.
 * Rules with mutliple conditions
 * Sub-rules (i.e. a rule can only be triggered if its parent is)
 * Triggered rules (i.e. only allow rules to be triggered in specific events (these are glorified equivalence conditions))

To Do
-----------------------------------------
 * Write how to use section
 * Write test cases (NUnit) to prove usage

Might Do
-----------------------------------------
 * Multi-Triggers (All of the triggers must be present)

Low Possibility
-----------------------------------------
 * No Triggers, just conditions (make all string triggers be equivalence conditions, and date times be more specific to ideas).
